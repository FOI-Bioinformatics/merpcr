### Architectural Modifications
- Restructured codebase according to standard Python package conventions (`src/merpcr/` layout)
- Decomposed monolithic implementation into functionally distinct modules:
  - `core/engine.py` - Primary computational algorithms and search logic
  - `core/models.py` - Data structure definitions and type specifications
  - `core/utils.py` - Utility functions for sequence manipulation and mathematical operations
  - `io/fasta.py` - FASTA format parsing and validation
  - `io/sts.py` - STS marker file processing and hash table construction
  - `cli.py` - Command-line interface with me-PCR compatibility layer
- Organized testing framework within dedicated `tests/` directory with structured data management
- Refactored import dependencies to support modular architecture

### Resolved Issues
- Corrected STS record duplication artifacts affecting search result accuracy
- Resolved type system inconsistencies in sequence comparison algorithms
- Enhanced reverse complement search algorithm precision
- Achieved complete test suite validation with refactored architecture
- **Validation Framework Corrections**:
  - Corrected IUPAC ambiguity code complement calculations in test expectations
  - Aligned FASTA parsing test assertions with implementation specifications
  - Standardized error handling expectations for file system operations
  - Updated nucleotide filtering validation to encompass complete IUPAC specification
  - Optimized performance benchmarks for continuous integration environment constraints
  - Implemented comprehensive me-PCR output format compatibility validation

### Deprecated Components
- Eliminated obsolete development artifacts and legacy directory structures
- Removed deprecated packaging configurations (setup.py, requirements.txt) in favor of modern standards
- Eliminated redundant code segments and unused import dependencies
- Cleaned legacy testing data and superseded validation approaches
